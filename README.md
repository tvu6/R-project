# Overview
This project explores, analyzes, and visualizes data using R programming language and related libraries. It provides scripts, notebooks, and visualizations demonstrating various data analysis techniques and visualization methods. The purpose is to learn about billionaires around the world and explore if there are trends considering education level, background, and family status.

# Dataset
Includes basic personal information: names, net-worth, country of origin, source, rank, age, residence, citizenship, marital status, children, education, self-made, geometry

# Key features
  - Data Processing: R scripts and Jupyter notebooks demonstrating data import, cleaning, and preprocessing techniques.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Code examples for exploratory data analysis, including summary statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis.
  - Statistical Modeling: R scripts showcasing statistical modeling techniques such as linear regression analysis, classification, or hypothesis testing.
  - Visualizations: Code and examples for creating insightful visualizations using corrplot, cook distance, diagnostic plots, or other visualization libraries.
  - Documentation: Detailed explanations within scripts and notebooks, providing insights into the analysis performed.

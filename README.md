names, net-worth, country of origin, source, rank, age, residence, citizenship, marital status, children, education, self-made, geometry

# Coding
#### Structure the dataset:
  + knn from VIM library to imputee missing values
  + remove zero and nearzero variances 
  + created dummy variables
#### Correlation/Prediction:
  + linear regression model
  + classification model 
  + testing and training dataset
#### Test error using KNN to find most efficient model
  - k=1,3,5
#### Graphs:
  + cook distance (with red abline
  + corrrelation graph
  + diagnostics plots: residuals and fitted, normal Q-Q, scale-location
# Instruction
